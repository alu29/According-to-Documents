        <h2>In a news story, these three words &mdash; &quot;According to Documents&quot; &mdash; demonstrate investigative journalism of the highest caliber. We want to celebrate reporters who obtain government reports, internal company emails or private chat messages in order to highlight how journalism based on concrete evidence makes for smarter, deeper stories.
            <br><br>
            Itâ€™s an imperfect rule of thumb, of course, and some excellent reporting will be based on no documents and some terrible reporting will be based on many documents.
            <br><br>
