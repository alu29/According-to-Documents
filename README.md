This site is written in HTML and CSS for the frontend and PHP connecting to a Google Firestore database for the backend.

It is hosted on Google App Engine hence the `.yaml` file.

The idea was to both highlight serious investigative journalism and teach Alexandra to code (hence the `test` files and broken down logic). It also allowed me to migrate away from my standard Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP (LAMP) servers to App Engine and play around with a NoSQL database (FireStore).

(At some point, I'll generalize my CSVtoFireStore.php script which I'm sure will come in useful to those making the same leap.)

**Girish**
